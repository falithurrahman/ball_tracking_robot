### Description

In this project i made a simple robot that will track the movement of designated object, in this case was a ball, and moved itself following the object. The ball used in this project is a tennis ball with solid color, made it easy to be identified. To drive the motor, i used L298 driver motor connected with the GPIO from the raspberry pi. I used opencv library for image processing and wiringpi to control the GPIO from raspberry. Block diagram of the component used in this project can be seen below.
